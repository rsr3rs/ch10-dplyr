# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `nycflights13` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data
dep_delay_by_month <- group_by(flights, month) %>% 
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
max_mean_dep_delay <- max(dep_delay_by_month$mean_dep_delay)

# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay"
# in that order), you can create
# a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the 'plot()' function
select(dep_delay_by_month, month, mean_dep_delay) %>% 
  plot()

# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarize your data
# You can use the `head()` function to view just the first few rows
group_by(flights, dest) %>% 
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(-mean_arr_delay) %>% head(1)

# You can look up these airports in the `airports` data frame!
View(airports)

# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
group_by(flights, dest) %>% mutate(speed = distance/time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_speed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
              arrange(-mean_speed) %>% head()
